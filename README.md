### Summary
This project marks the culmination of Benjamin's and Srinanda's journey through UMass Amherst's Game Programming class in the Fall of '23. Motivated by Srinanda's vision to craft an engaging game that imparts insights into data size and computer networks, our collaborative effort resulted in a unique and strategic gaming experience.

Embark on an unpredictable adventure as the game generates a dynamic set of 3-5 tracks, each with varying lengths. The challenge lies in strategically choosing the right track for dispatching packages. The core gameplay loop empowers players to select a lane and then unleash specific packages using designated buttons, each subject to a cooldown from previous presses.

The packages, upon impact, contribute varying percentages to the health of the targeted side. The first side to reach 100% succumbs to defeat. Adding an intriguing twist, we've incorporated a mechanic where the collision of two packages results in a reduction of their size.

Immerse yourself in the exciting blend of strategy and quick decision-making, all while delving into the fascinating realms of data size and computer networks.

For the Professor, in regards to "parts each team member wrote":

For this project, Ben and Srinanda's scripts are separate within the project, and while they did modify each other's scripts, the majority of a folder's scripts is done by the parent's directory (Ben and Nandu) name. There was also a team effort involved in combining our scripts when we created for the gameplay features, in order to fully make the game.

Generally, ben worked on generation scripts such as BaseWireGeneration, GenerateMap, and LaneWireGeneration, as well as big feature scripts such as ChooseWire, HpScript, and GameEndEvents.

Srinanda worked on key gameplay elements such as the pole's Packet and SpawnPacket scripts, the AI, the MainMenu script and the PauseManager scripts.
