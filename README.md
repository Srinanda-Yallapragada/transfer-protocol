Final Project  for CS576 @ UMass 

For the Professor, in regards to "parts each team member wrote":

For this project, Ben and Nandu's scripts are separate within the project, and while they did modify each other's scripts, the majority of a folder's scripts is done by the parent's directory name. There was also a team effort involved in combining our scripts when we created for the gameplay features, in order to fully make the game.

Generally, ben worked on generation scripts such as BaseWireGeneration, GenerateMap, and LaneWireGeneration, as well as big feature scripts such as ChooseWire, HpScript, and GameEndEvents.

Nandu worked on key gameplay elements such as the pole's Packet and SpawnPacket scripts, as well as the MainMenu script and the PauseManager scripts.
